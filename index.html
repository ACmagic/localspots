							<h2>How we are</h2>
							<p>We’re some Aussies who have banded together to help small businesses stay afloat during the COVID-19 crisis. With more and more people forced to stay at home, small local businesses will struggle maintaining cashflow and supporting their own workers. Gift cards are a way of supporting businesses through these tough times, so that when the COVID-19 crisis finally passes your favourite local spots will still be left standing. So come lend an elbow tap and help out your community.</p>

									<h3>Mounish Raja</h3>
									<p>Product Associate at Freelancer. Was on the toilet ruminating about COVID-19, small businesses and the proverbial hitting the fan when he realised that what small local businesses needed was money now so that they could provide their services later. A win-win for small businesses and their local customer base. So instead of re-inventing the wheel, he looked up the laws surrounding the selling of gift cards. And also managed to rope in a friend.</p>

									<h3>Tina Wu</h3>
									<p>Medical Student at the University of Sydney. Was at home watching lectures online when she got a message from Mounish. Figured her background in Computer Science and Management Consulting would be useful in getting this platform running. When she thought of her favourite gelato place going under, she audibly gasped, closed her lecture and messaged a mate.</p>

									<h3>Aolei Yu</h3>
									<p>Medical Student at the University of Sydney. Was receiving a lecture from a well-meaning friend about the pros and cons of stimulus packages during recessions when Tina’s notification popped up. With his ears he heard “Currently the issue isn’t that people don’t have money to spend, it’s that they don’t want to go outside to spend it….” and with his eyes he saw LocalSpots as a way for people to spend in the present so that their favourite local businesses could stay afloat in the future. (This actually took him a few minutes as he can’t multitask). When it finally dawned on him that this was a good idea, he hopped to it and rang Tian.</p>

									<h3>Tian Shou</h3>
									<p>Principal Product Manager at Prospa. Initially rolled his eyes when he saw that it was Aolei calling him. Again. But by the end of the phone call had somehow agreed to being an advisor and manager. Helped nut out the details and guide LocalSpots past some otherwise unseen obstacles.</p>
