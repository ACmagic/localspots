									<h3>How does pre-purchasing a gift card help out my local spots?</h3>
									<p>Australian businesses are currently experiencing huge declines in customer numbers due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Pre-purchasing gift cards gives businesses a boost of much-needed cash flow to cover fixed costs (think rent, bills and employee wages). Together we can help these businesses stay afloat until they can get back to business as usual.</p>
